You are Claude Code. Generate BMAD story files for this repo.

GOAL
- Create BMAD story files as markdown in a deterministic SEQUENTIAL execution order.
- Stories must NEVER be in random order.
- The numbering OPS-001, OPS-002, ... is the canonical execution order.

INPUTS (already in repo)
- BMAD_STORY_LLM_PLAYBOOK  Seq force_claude.md (single source of truth for story structure and hard rules)
- AI_STACK_STANDARD_BMAD_WORKTREES_GUARDRAILS seq force_claude.md (worktrees + guardrails)

OUTPUT PATHS (hard)
- Create folder: stories_claude/<process>/
- Create files: OPS-001.md, OPS-002.md, OPS-003.md, ... (numbered, preferably no gaps)
- Create BACKLOG.md: stories_claude/<process>/BACKLOG.md (for Ralph Loop tracking)

BACKLOG.md FORMAT (hard)
```markdown
# BACKLOG - <process>

| Story | Status | Attempts | Notes |
|-------|--------|----------|-------|
| OPS-001 | [TODO] | 0 | |
| OPS-002 | [TODO] | 0 | |
...
```

STORY REQUIREMENTS (hard)
Each story file MUST:

1) Follow the canonical headers/order from the playbook:
   Context, Story, Acceptance Criteria, Tasks/Subtasks, Dev Notes, Dev Agent Record, Status

2) FIRST TASK (hard): Every story's Tasks/Subtasks section MUST start with:
   - [ ] Lees CLAUDE.md (repo-root) voor project regels en context

3) LAST TASK (hard): Every story's Tasks/Subtasks section MUST end with:
   - [ ] Run Gate A checks: `ruff check . && ruff format --check . && pytest` (alle checks moeten groen zijn)

4) Acceptance Criteria (ACs):
   - Every AC has EXACTLY 1 verification command + Expected output/exit/result.
   - Commands are repo-root unless explicitly stated otherwise.
   - If any verification is not executable, mark story Status as drafted (fail-closed).
   - Every AC MUST reference a CTO Rule ID from docs/CTO_RULES.md (traceability).

CTO TRACEABILITY (hard)
For EACH AC, include these additional lines:
- CTO Rule: `<RULE_ID>` (e.g., SEC-001, TEST-001, ARCH-001)
- CTO Facet: `<FACET>` (e.g., Security, Testing, Architecture)

Common CTO Rule IDs:
- SEC-xxx: Security (auth, secrets, input validation)
- TEST-xxx: Testing (coverage, assertions, edge cases)
- ARCH-xxx: Architecture (separation, dependencies, patterns)
- CODE-xxx: Code Quality (linting, formatting, complexity)
- OPS-xxx: Operations (logging, monitoring, error handling)
- DOC-xxx: Documentation (docstrings, README, comments)

5) VERIFICATION MARKERS (hard; must be literal for parsing)
For EACH AC, write these two lines EXACTLY (same labels, same punctuation):

- Verification (repo-root): `<command>`
- Expected: `<expected output/exit/result>`

If an AC must run outside repo-root, write EXACTLY:

- Verification (cwd=<path>): `<command>`
- Expected: `<expected output/exit/result>`

Notes:
- Use backticks around the command and expected value exactly as shown.
- Do not wrap these lines in code fences.

6) Dev Notes MUST include:
   - Scope + Out-of-scope (hard)
   - No broad refactors rule (hard)
   - Touched paths allowlist (repo-relative, exact prefixes)
   - A subset check note: `git diff --name-only <BASE_REF_SHA>...HEAD` must be subset of allowlist
   - Test/gate commands relevant to the touched paths
   - Rollback plan (at least 1 command)

DETERMINISTIC ORDER DESIGN (hard)
- OPS-001 should be scaffolding / harness / plumbing required by later stories.
- Later stories build on earlier ones. Hardening/edge cases last.
- Avoid cross-story overlap: touched paths should be as disjoint as realistically possible.

OPTIONAL BUT RECOMMENDED
Create docs/processes/<process>/PROCESS.md containing:
- `execution_mode: sequential`
- `## Canonical Story Order (Sequential Default)` listing all OPS-xxx in the same order
- compact dependencies per story (depends_on)

HOW TO DERIVE STORIES
- Inspect the repo: existing docs, scripts, TODOs, failing tests, and in-repo requirements.
- Propose a minimal, correct story set that can be executed sequentially without merge pain.
- Do NOT invent external requirements.

DELIVERABLES
- New markdown story files under stories_claude/<process>/
- Optional PROCESS.md under docs/processes/<process>/
- Commit all created files with message: "add BMAD stories (canonical order)"

NOW IMPLEMENT
- Generate the story files.
- Ensure numbering/order is correct and dependency-safe.
